##Part-01(Find the faculty)
As I am a begginer in programming and new to linux commands I have cloned the git repository in my files. i have found that a new folder named Terminal-Hunt found and have entered to it through a linux command "cd".

I have used "grep" command to find the Earth folder 

I have used "locate" command to find facility and I have found in Russia/Vladimir_oblast

I have found facility by using the command "ls-a" as the .facility is a secret file i got to know that "ls-a" command is used to find is any secret file or folder in a file.

I have gone to .facility and again used "ls-a" and found a text file named gravity_equation.txt and have entered to it using "cat" command and i have found a string in it.
##Part-02(Enter the wormhole)
I have used again the commands "cd" and "locate" to find where the wormhole is and i have found that it is in Terminal-hunt/Saturn/Ring.

Then i have tried many commands to enter to that already found wormhole

later I google it for the command and found the command "chmod +x" is used to enter the .sh file

I executed the file using the command "./" command

I have taken the screen shot of my second key andcreated a new folder using "mkdir" command and  used "echo","cat" commands to save the second key in a key2.txt file in Andhra pradesh.

##Part-03(Analyse the planets in Gargantuan System)
This is to change the git branch from Solar_System to Gargantua.

I have got to know some basic git commands with this part in the first task.

I have used a command "git checkout-b" git checkout-b Gargantuasystem

with the help of this command the git branch changed from Gargantua from Solar_System

I have used some commands like "grep","cd","ls -a","cat" and finally found a file named HABITABLE.txt and I found the habitable zone
##Part-04(Gargantua)
As we need to find a message from them.

so,I have gone through the folder named ".thecore" and gone through the file ".messagefromthem.txt" and by again usind "cd","ls -a","cat" command.

And I decoded thr base-64 coded word using "echo" command.

## **These are the commands I have used to finish the Task-01(Terminal-Hunt)**
